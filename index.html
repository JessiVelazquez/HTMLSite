        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/700x150">
        <p>This restaurant serves the steaks. They have the meats! Oh wait, that is Arby's.
            This restaurant has much better meats than Arby's. They have big steaks. You know
            they are good because all of the ranchers in Texas congregate for the annual
            networking events here at Longhorn Steakhouse. You can have mash potatoes too.
            And/or salad. I like steaks. You like steaks. We all like steaks. Let's all 
            go to Longhorn Steakhouse! See you there! This descritpion is not affiliated with

        <h2>Goode Seafood Company</h2>
        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/700x150">
        <p>They have lobsters. They have clams!! The prawns are big. No one has EVER been 
            disappointed here. YOU DO NOT LEAVE HUNGRY. They have really good sashimi! Fish are
            in the sea. They are also at Goode Seafood Company!! I really like Goode Seafood 
            Company. The plate has a lemon on it. You are supposed to squeeze that on the fish.
            Or the prawns!! Maybe you like prawns more than fish, in that case you should
            order prawns. Choice of fries or salad. This discription is not associated with
